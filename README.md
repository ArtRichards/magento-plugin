Bitcoin payment module using the bitpay.com service.

Installation
------------
Copy these files into your Magento directory.

Configuration
-------------
1. Create an API key at bitpay.com by clicking My Account > API Access Keys > Add New API Key.
2. In Admin panel under "System > Configuration > Sales > Payment Methods > Bitcoins":
	a. Verify that the module is enabled.
	b. Enter your API key 
	c. Select a transaction speed.  The high speed will send a confirmation as soon as a transaction is received in the bitcoin network (usually a few seconds).  A medium speed setting will typically take 10 minutes.  The low speed setting usually takes around 1 hour.  See the bitpay.com merchant documentation for a full description of the transaction speed settings.
	d. Verify that the currencies option includes your store's currencies.  If it doesn't, check bitpay.com to see if they support your desired currency.  If so, you may simply add the currency to the list using this setting.  If not, you will not be able to use that currency.  

Usage
-----
When a shopping chooses the Bitcoin payment method, they will be presented with an order summary as the next step (prices are shown in whatever currency they've selected for shopping).  Upon receiving their order, the system takes the shopper to a bitpay.com invoice where the user is presented with bitcoin payment instructions.  Once payment is received, a link is presented to the shopper that will take them to their "My Account" page.

In your Admin control panel, you can see the invoices associated with each order made with Bitcoins.  The invoice will tell you whether payment has been received.  

Note: This extension does not provide a means of automatically pulling a current BTC exchange rate for presenting BTC prices to shoppers.
